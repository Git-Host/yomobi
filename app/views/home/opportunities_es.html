  <h3>Get Involved</h3>
  <p>The mobile space is growing rapidly, yet most small businesses around the world do not have a mobile-optimized site. Now is the perfect time to tap into this market and develop a skill that can generate income.<p>

  <h3>Anyone Can Do It</h3>
  <p>We welcome website developers, SEO and marketing consultants, freelancers, college and high school students, social media marketers and entrepreneurs to use YoMobi to build mobile sites for small businesses and individuals. No programming skills are required.</p>

  <h3>It's Easy to Learn</h3>
  <p>Creating a standard interactive mobile site with YoMobi takes only a few minutes. If you choose to create additional pages, such as a mobile-optimized Menu for a restaurant or list of Services for a business, a typical mobile site takes 2-4 hours to complete. Once a site is built, it only takes minutes to update. YoMobi even includes a <a href="http://help.yomobi.com/SiteManager">Multiple Site Manager</a> that allows you to easily build and manage multiple sites from a single account.</p>

  <h3>How You Benefit</h3>
  <p>You charge the customer a one-time fee for building their mobile site based on your level of effort. You can also charge the customer a maintenance fee if they would like you to handle site administration and updates. With social media integration, email and text blasts, mobile coupons, reservation/booking links, review links and more, you easily provide a lot of value to your clients.</p>

  <h3>How to Get Started</h3>
  <p><a href="http://yomobi.com/users/sign_up">Start by signing up for a YoMobi account.</a> It's free, fast and easy. If you are new to using a do-it-yourself platform like YoMobi.com, familiarize yourself with the platform by creating an interactive e-business card for yourself. <a href="http://kdr.yomobi.com">Click here for an example</a>. Once you are ready to market your skills, we've found that an effective way to build a customer base is to choose a small business and create a mobile site based on their existing desktop site. Once their mobile site is ready, visit the business and speak with the manager to demonstrate how much better the mobile-optimized version of their site looks and works on a mobile phone. Start building your customer base slowly and let them refer you. You may also want to partner with someone that does SEO/Marketing Consulting and build sites for them.</p>

  <h3>Provide a Good Value</h3>
  <p>Our goal at YoMobi is to make the mobile space accessible to businesses so they can take advantage of the new revenue and customer streams that mobile commerce represents, provide a more interactive site to reach their mobile customers, and enhance their visitor-to-customer conversion rates. We've kept our fees low to promote our vision. We recommend that you set reasonable fees to advance that goal as well.</p>
