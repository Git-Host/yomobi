  <h2>Business/Consultant Opportunities</h2>
  <p>The mobile space is growing rapidly, yet most small businesses around the world do not have a mobile-optimized site. Now is the perfect time to tap into this market and develop a skill that can generate income.<p>

  <p>We welcome website developers, SEO and marketing consultants, freelancers, college and high school students, social media marketers, and entrepreneurs to use YoMobi to build mobile sites for small businesses and individuals. To the micro business owner you would bring great value by creating the mobile site, possibly updating it and your marketing/SEO knowledge and as such you deserve to be paid for your services.</p>

  <p>Please note that the idea is to make the mobile space accessible to micro-businesses so they can take advantage of the new revenue and customer streams that mobile commerce represents, to provide a more interactive site to reach their mobile customers, and to enhance their visitor-to-customer conversion rates. We recommend that you set reasonable fees to advance that goal.</p>

  <p>We have created a Multiple Site Manager that allows you to easily build and manage multiple mobile sites per email account (no programming is required). Once you have completed a site, you could either keep managing the site for the client for a nominal fee or train the business owner to manage it themselves. A complete site takes about 2 to 4 hours to build (for which you deserve a building fee) and after that it only takes minutes for updates (for which you can charge a fee to maintain). With social media integration, email and text blasts, coupon pages, reservation/booking links, review links, etc., you would be able to provide a lot of marketing value to your client.</p>

  <p>If you are new to using platforms like YoMobi.com, you may want to practice building your own Business Card Site (such as http://kdr.yomobi.com). Â And maybe even practice making a few other mom and pop business sites before beginning to charge. Start building your customer base slowly and let them refer you. Or you may want to partner with someone that does SEO/Marketing Consulting and build sites for them.</p>

  <p>If any of you would like to notify us that you are creating sites for businesses, we encourage you to send us the URLs for the sites you have created. We would like to build a consultant referral base to send leads your way. You would need to agree to our $25/hour rate for building and to train the client and hand-off the site (unless you both can come to an agreement to do updates for a fee).<p/>
