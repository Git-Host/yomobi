  <h3>Let YoMobi Build Your Site For You</h3>
  <p>Even though the YoMobi platform is so easy that you can do it yourself with minimal effort using content from your existing desktop website or facebook page, we realize how busy business owners are, so we're happy to get you started by building your site for you. We offer a lot of value for a very low price because our goal is to make the mobile-commerce space accessible to everyone.</p>
  <h3>Consulting Fees:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>$25 flat fee to build a standard site<span class="notation-number">3</span></li>
  <li>$25 per hour for additional pages</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A typical site takes 2 to 4 hours depending on the number of pages and products/services uploaded. If you would like us to build your site please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@yomobi.com">support@yomobi.com</a>. Once we are done building your site, we will transfer ownership of the site to you. We can also provide training on how to optimally use and manage your site for the standard consulting rate.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>Once a site is created, updates take only minutes and you will be able to continue to maintain it very easily on your own.
