Thanks for using YoMobi. A customer has left a message and requested that you call back at (<%=@params[:customer_phone] %>). Here's what he/she said:
<br /><br />
<blockquote><%= @params[:customer_message] %></blockquote>
<br /><br />
You can respond to this customer via the phone number he/she provided: <%= @params[:customer_phone] %>
