Thanks for using YoMobi. A customer has left a message and requested that you call back at (<%=@params[:customer_phone] %>). Here's what he/she said:
<br />
<br />

| <%= @params[:customer_message] %>
<br />
<br />

You can respond to this customer via the phone number he/she provided: <%= @params[:customer_phone] %>
